## Observable Trends

* Non-males spend more per purchase on average than males, by $0.18 for females and $0.33 for other/non-disclosed. 
  The two groups have higher average total purchases per person as well. Depsite this, the average purchase price 
  per male is very close to the overall average purchase price (due to the overwhelming number of males in the data sample).

* The two highest spending age groups on average (per purchase and total per person) are the youngest age group 
  and the second oldest, under 10 and between 35-39. No other age groups exceed the overall average purchase price.

* With a little extra arithmetic, 780 purchases divided by 576 purchasers equals 1.35 purchases per user. Considering 
  there had to be a purchase made to be in the data (i.e. no SN's with non-purchases), the overwhelming number of users
  only make a single purchase. This would lead us in the direction of the top 5 spenders potentially being outliers with 
  3, 4, or 5 purchases each.
